I'm not sure where to put credits so I'll put them here.

Thanks to:
    Quek, from whom I borrowed some code (which I think is legal to do because of his license, more info here: https://github.com/quek04/The-Undergarden/blob/1.16/LICENSE)
    Screem, who volunteered to make some assets. Specifically, the kyanite crystal, soapstone block, and permafrost block textures.
    "Wind Chimes, A.wav" by InspectorJ (www.jshaw.co.uk) of Freesound.org (Used this for the portal sound, which I edited a little bit)
