    /*
    - HUMMINGBIRD
    Make it faster
    Should be constantly moving
    Fix the texture

    - WORLD GENERATION
    Make dirt not spawn under Giantwood trees
    Clouds should be less ugly (remove for now)

    - HOT SPRINGS
    Complete redesign needed
    Potentially use calcite instead of pumice
    Geysers should be prettier
    White mud should spawn at the bottom of the ponds
